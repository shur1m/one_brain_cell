# It's even better than PB&J...

One Brain Cell is a Spaced Repetition flashcard app that is written for people (and non-people!) with the [memory of a goldfish](https://aquariumsphere.com/goldfish-memory-span/#:~:text=Scientists%20have%20revealed%20through%20their,goldfish%20possess%20a%20strong%20memory.). With One Brain Cell and your brain cell, you can learn almost anything with enough time. Even if your memory is better than mine, One Brain Cell is easily customizable to fit your needs. It's time to throw away Anki and it's hour long tutorials. It's time to learn.

The app is currently in progress! Here's a little preview of the UI. The build so far features an SQLite database for your flashcards, a working folder system, and data visualization for your hard earned stats.
